## Exercise 7 - The Bookstore

### How to get started

Click the "Fork" button at the top of the editor to copy the exercise.

### Exercise goal

Make the book search engine from Goodreads.com work correctly. 

To be considered to have completed the task, as a user I should be able to:
1. type a phrase with the name of a book into the search box
2) Press the `Search` button to retrieve data from Goodreads.com
3. see five sample results from the Goodreads API, including the cover and book name.

### Bonus points

1) Expand your search results with the name of the author
2. expand the results with a link to the book details on `Goodreads.com`.

The API you can use is at `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://www.goodreads.com/book/auto_complete?format=json&q=harry%20potter`, where `q` is the parameter with the book name.
